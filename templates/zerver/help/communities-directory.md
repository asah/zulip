# Zulip communities directory

{!communities-directory-intro.md!}

In order to be eligible for listing in the communities directory, an
organization must be open to the public. Your organization is eligible if users are
allowed [join without an invitation][join-without-invite] and/or the [public
access option](/help/public-access-option) is enabled.

The directory will be organized by [organization type](/help/organization-type),
so it is highly recommended that you make sure the appropriate category is
selected.

To prevent spam, Zulip reserves the right to use editorial discretion. Giving
Zulip permission to promote your organization in the communities directory does
not guarantee that it will be listed.

If you administer a self-hosted Zulip community that you would like to be
listed, please contact [Zulip support](mailto:support@zulip.com).
